1. Overall design
  Scene graph:
    - Main gameplay scene
    - City map overlay scene
      On top of that:
        - Player state management
  a) Main gameplay scene
    - 2.5D view with isometric tiles
    - Player character moving in continuous space
    - Player should collide with obstacles (solid objects, other entities like NPCs)
    - TODO: Think about how to handle player interactions with stuff
  b) City map overlay scene
    - Something like OpenStreeMap
    - Roads, walkable paths
    - Buildings and place that can take player to a Main Gameplay Scene for that area
    - Player (other players, NPCs?) avatars
  c) Player state management
    - Going for that excel feel
    - Main window with player avatar, name, surname (maybe some other information, like money in wallet, on
      bank account) and buttons to all other stuff that might be added later (inventory and stuff)
    - TODO: we might want to have more information later in development (like info about objects in the city)
